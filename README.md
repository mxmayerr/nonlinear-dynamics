# nonlinear-dynamics

**Welcome to my Nonlinear Dynamics Repository**
Nonlinear Dynamics is the study of maps and their dynamics. You can learn more about these systems here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system](url).

This repository contains previous projects I have completed:
- Quadratic Equation Explorer

And ones that I am working on:
- Logistic Map Explorere

They are all based in Python and a custom graphics library.
