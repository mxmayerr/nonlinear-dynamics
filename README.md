# Nonlinear Dynamics

Welcome to my Nonlinear Dynamics project repository.

## Learn 

 - [Nonlinear System - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system)
 - [Newton's Method - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method)
 - [Logistic Map - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map)


## Running My Code

This code is written in Python and works off of the DEGraphics library included in the /lib folder. Make sure that this /lib folder is in the running directory before you try to run one of the projects.


You may need to install libraries for some projects (if it has a requirements.txt file). To do this, run the following command in the running directory:
```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Projects

The following projects are included in the repository folder:

- **Quadratic Equation Explorer**
    - This explores the quadratic equation and its roots
- **Logistic Map Explorer**
  - This explores parts of the logistic map like the bifurcation diagram and the time-series plot
- **Newton's Method Explorer**
  - This explores the behavior of Newton's Method on various points on the screen
