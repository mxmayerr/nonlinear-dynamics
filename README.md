# nonlinear-dynamics

**Welcome to my Nonlinear Dynamics Repository**
Nonlinear Dynamics is the study of maps and their dynamics. You can learn more about these systems here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system](url). This repository is deticated to exploration of these types of maps.

The explorer files create GUIs based on the DEGraphics python library. This is contained in the lib folder.

This repository contains projects I have completed:
- Quadratic Equation Explorer
- Logistic Map Explorer
- Newton's Method Explorer

And ones that I am working on:


 
 **USAGE**
 Make sure to run the following command in the main directory:
 
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt'''
